European Social Survey (ESS) 2018 data was downloaded from this (https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/download.html?file=ESS9e03_1&y=2018) site with the intent of using the Human Values (https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/themes.html?t=values) themed questions. Downloading the data required creating an account using my Georgetown email. The data was retrieved as a STATA .dta file and stored in the data/raw folder of this project.
